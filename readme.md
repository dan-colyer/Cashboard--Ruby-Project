## Design/Brief: MoneyCashboard

Make a budgeting app to help you see where all of your money is being spent.

### MVP:

- Create new transactions
- Display a list of all transactions
- Display total amount spent
- Display total amount spent by tag

### Possible Extensions:

- CRUD actions for the transactions
- Show a warning when the total expenditure is over budget (set a hard coded budget first)
- Add a date to the transactions and view total spending by month
- Any other ideas you might come up with  

## Technologies Used:
- Ruby
- PSQL
- HTML
- CSS


## Planning:
- Proto Personas
- MoSCoW method
- UX Planning


## Outcome
The app achieves the MVP along with added functionality (such as CRUD actions on Tags and Merchants)


## Moving Forward

Addition of Javascript will allow a more responsive and streamlined app.
